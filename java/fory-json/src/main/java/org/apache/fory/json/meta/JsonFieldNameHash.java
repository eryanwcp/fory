/**
 * Internal field-name key shared by concrete readers and metadata lookup tables.
 *
 * <p>Non-empty names of at most eight nonzero Latin1 code units use their bytes packed from least
 * to most significant. All other names use an FNV-1a-style hash over the decoded UTF-16 code units.
 * Object metadata owners that dispatch only by this key reject duplicate keys before publishing
 * their lookup tables, allowing readers to dispatch without materializing a String. An untrusted
 * input collision grants no additional field or enum capability because the input could select the
 * same target by sending its canonical JSON name.
 *
 * <p>For both inline-property and wrapper inclusions, closed-subtype lookup uses this key only to
 * select a candidate. It still compares the complete decoded discriminator property and logical
 * subtype name before selecting a class.
