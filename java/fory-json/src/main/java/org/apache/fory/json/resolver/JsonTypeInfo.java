/**
 * JSON type binding resolved and owned by {@link JsonTypeResolver}.
 *
 * <p>The five capability fields are deliberately ordinary fields. A resolver-local JIT lock covers
 * every root graph operation and every generated capability installation, so lock release and the
 * next root acquisition publish slot changes without adding volatile reads to established codec
 * dispatch. These five fields are the sole installed capability state; there are no parallel
 * per-path maps to reconcile on the hot path.
 *
 * <p>{@link JsonTypeResolver} owns canonical exact raw-class {@link ObjectCodec} identity and the
 * corresponding stable metadata owner. This binding stores only installed capabilities; custom
 * codecs, parameterized object bindings, containers, scalars, and dynamic {@code Object} bindings
 * retain their original semantic owner. Each complete capability is installed in its own
 * independently lazy slot.
