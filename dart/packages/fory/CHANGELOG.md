## 1.6.0-dev

- Start the next development cycle after the 1.5.0 release.

## 1.5.0

- Release Apache Fory Dart 1.5.0.
- Add generated external-type serialization with direct target construction
  and existing registration, carrier, reference, and schema-evolution support.
- Replace `ForyField.skip` with `ForyField.ignore`, remove `skip` from container
  field annotations, and include ignored and discoverable external target
  fields in graph-memory accounting.
- Flatten ordinary `ForyStruct` superclass and applied-mixin storage into the
  concrete child's generated schema. Public and same-library private fields use
  direct access; cross-library private fields require
  `exposePrivateFields: true` on a public boundary in each declaring library.
- Reject hidden, inaccessible, unsupported, or unconstructable included
  inherited storage instead of silently omitting it. Included `final` and
  `late final` fields now require a proven identity-preserving constructor
  path.
- Add `ForyStruct.ignoreInheritedPrivateFields`, defaulting to `false`, so a
  concrete ordinary child can explicitly omit all private superclass and
  applied-mixin storage from its own flattened schema. Child-declared private
  fields and inherited public fields remain included; setting the option to
  `true` on external and provider-only declarations is rejected.
- This inheritance correction is a breaking generated-schema change. Regenerate
  all affected `.fory.dart` files; fixed-schema payloads written when inherited
  fields were omitted are not supported by a compatibility reader. External
  target declarations remain explicit, and inheritance does not change the
  runtime reference protocol.
