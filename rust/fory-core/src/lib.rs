//! Core runtime for Apache Fory's Rust implementation.
//!
//! [`Serializer`] statically handles one associated [`Serializer::Target`]. An ordinary local
//! type serializes itself. A local external structural serializer or custom serializer can
//! target a type owned by another crate without creating a wrapper value.
//!
//! [`Fory`] exposes ordinary roots for self-serializing types and four explicit-serializer roots:
//! [`Fory::serialize_with`], [`Fory::serialize_to_with`], [`Fory::deserialize_with`], and
//! [`Fory::deserialize_from_with`]. Fory-owned carrier serializers such as [`VecSerializer`] and
//! [`HashMapSerializer`] recursively compose child serializers while preserving standard carrier
//! wire formats.
//!
//! Application traits extend [`ForyObject`] and use [`register_trait_type!`] with a closed list of
//! concrete target types. Concrete targets are dispatched through their registered serializer;
//! serializer declarations and Rust trait names never appear on the wire.

// Direct lower-level derive users may resolve this crate through `::fory_core`, including
// doctests where `crate` is the doctest crate instead of this runtime crate.
